# TFdex
Continuation of Pokemon reaserch first shown in PokeColor repository. A part of Pokedex project
I use tensorflow toutorial code for basic NN setup
I'm using Database from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types
At the moment model is not tuned. Dataset seems to be hard and there is big overfitting.
